# HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION

The Heart Disease Prediction System is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate, and other health parameters.

The system helps in early detection of heart-related risks and supports healthcare decision-making using data-driven analysis.
